          not break contractual obligations with the venue. The set was sandwiched between two sets of Electron.

          NJ they again performed under this alternate band name, but with a new twist. All of the songs played at this
          show were played in alternate styles. Mindless Dribble and Sister Judy's Soul Shack were played in a dub
          style, I-man and 7-11 (affectionately referred to as WaWa) were played in a techno style, Sound One was played
          Honkey Tonk, and more. This was also the first performance of Pilin it High in a breakbeat style. While many
          of these alternate versions were one-offs, Pilin it High(er) as it is sometimes referred to by fans, has stuck
          around and has been performed predominantly in this style since.
