              For many runners, long-form high-intensity music is the best way to get through a workout. As luck would
              have it, this is what The Disco Biscuits do best.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              As much as we all love their compositions, sometimes the first 10 minutes of the House Dog Party Favor
              composition aren't the ideal musical companion for pushing yourself up the side of a mountain. Sometimes
              you want to get right into the meat of the jam to fuel your ascent. That's where The Disco Biscuits
              Workout Mixes come in handy.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              These mixes are composed of hand-selected jams. In most cases, they segue into one another.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              I've found them to be the perfect musical companion for longer runs. Personally, these mixes helped me to
              get into running and forged a lifelong love for this band.{" "}

              took my casual fandom to full-blown obsession back in 2008, and I've been running to the Biscuits ever
              since. They've gotten me across the finish line in countless races, and I have yet to find any music more
              conducive to cardio.
