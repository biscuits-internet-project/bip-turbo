# Bip Turbo

A modern monorepo application built with Turborepo, React Router, and TypeScript.

## Project Overview

This monorepo is structured using pnpm workspaces and Turborepo for efficient build orchestration. It consists of multiple applications and shared packages that work together to provide a complete solution.

### Apps

- **web**: A React application built with React Router v7, using modern UI components with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It serves as the main frontend interface for the application.

### Packages

- **@bip/domain**: Contains the core domain models and business logic, implemented with TypeScript and Zod for validation. This package defines the shared types and interfaces used across the application.
- **@bip/core**: Provides database access and core functionality, including Prisma ORM integration, Redis caching, and PostgreSQL database connectivity.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, React Router v7, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Background Processing**: Temporal.io
- **Build Tools**: Turborepo, pnpm, Vite
- **Code Quality**: Biome (linting and formatting), TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Fly.io (with blue-green deployment strategy)
- **Environment Management**: Doppler

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or later
- Bun 22 or later
- Docker (for local development with PostgreSQL and Redis)
- Supabase

### Installation and local setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Prepare environment variables

```
doppler login
make doppler
```

2. Install dependencies and build source code:

```sh
make install
make build
```

3. Setup database

```
make db-generate
make db-start
make migrate
make migrate-baseline // the result should be something like "The migration `xxx` is already recorded as applied in the database."
export PROD_DATA_PATH=<the path to your db dump>
make db-load-data-dump
make db-scrub
```

4. Run the app
```
make web
```

### Type Checking

Run type checking across all packages:

```sh
make tc
```

### Linting

Run linting across all packages:

```sh
make lint
```

### Formatting

Format code across all packages:

```sh
make format
```
